This analysis aimed to explore the role of a serious game called Decisions for the Decade (D4tD)
in teaching students about climate change adaptation and decision making under deep
uncertainty within the context of this university’s civil and environmental engineering courses.
The game, developed by the Red Cross/Red Crescent Climate Center and the World Bank, was
designed to support learning and conversations about long-term investments under uncertainty
by making participants more familiar with the process of planning for extremes and climate
change impacts while minimizing risk. This work included three cohorts of students: two
graduate level courses and one undergraduate level course. The students’ self-reported
quantitative and qualitative results were analyzed to determine the impact of the D4tD game in
improving student understanding of and attitudes towards uncertainty and robust decision
making for climate change adaptation and planning. Quantitative results implied that students
found it difficult to make beneficial decisions as uncertainty increased. Students seemed to be
more cautious when making collective decisions compared to individual decisions. This
collective risk aversion highlighted the benefits of collective learning and decision making for
risk management. From the qualitative results, common themes (such as “Informed Decision
Making” and “Risk Preparedness”), common keywords (“flood”, “drought”, “climate”,
“uncertainty”), and varying emotions observed in student responses indicated students’
awareness of and growing understanding about uncertainty and robust decision making, and
pointed to the social/psychological aspects of playing the D4tD game and making decisions
under uncertainty. In conclusion, these results attest to the benefit of the D4tD game as a tool
within this university and departmental context to improve student understanding of and attitudes
towards uncertainty and robust decision making for climate change adaptation and risk
management.
