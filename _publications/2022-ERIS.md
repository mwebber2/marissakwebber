excerpt: 'In this paper, we analyze 48 major cities in the U.S. which developed climate adaptation and resilience plans, evaluate the implications of uncertainties across five available climate datasets, and show the level of climate resilience to extreme rainfall depends on the dataset selected for each city.'
