I'm pleased to share my first first-authored publication: [A Review of Decision Making Under Deep Uncertainty Applications Using Green Infrastructure for Flood Management](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021EF002322). This paper was co-authored by Dr. Costa Samaras, and is available open access in the AGU journal Earth's Future!
