It was such an honor to receive the Best Student Paper Award for the Environmental Division at American Society for Engineering Education 2024 Annual Conference!! 

CMU CEE Assistant Teaching Professor Fethiye Ozis, PhD, PE, ENV SP co-authored the winning paper: "Preparing the Next Generation of Engineers for Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty: Exploring the Pedagogical Role of Decisions for the Decade Game." I was grateful for the opportunity to present our work assessing how graduate and undergraduate students can learn about making decisions under the uncertainty and risk associated with climate change by playing serious games. 

What an amazing start to my last week as a PhD student! (more on that later ðŸ™‚)
