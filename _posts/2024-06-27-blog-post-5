I'm pleased to share that I successfully defended my Ph.D., titled "Monitoring and Modeling Urban Stormwater Infrastructure and Nature-Based Solutions for Effective and Equitable Climate Change Adaptation". 
Many thanks to my committee (Dr Costa Samaras, Dr David Rounce, Dr Sarah Fakherddine, and Dr Jordan Fischbach), my department and colleagues, my friends, and family - your constant love and support mean so much to me! And finally, thanks be to God: in Him I have lacked nothing. To Him be the glory!
