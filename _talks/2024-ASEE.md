This analysis aimed to explore the role of a serious game called Decisions for the Decade (D4tD) in teaching students about climate change adaptation and decision making under deep uncertainty within the context of this university’s civil and environmental engineering courses. Students’ self-reported quantitative and qualitative results were analyzed to determine the impact of the game in improving student understanding of and attitudes towards uncertainty and robust decision making for climate change adaptation and planning. Quantitative results implied that students found it difficult to make beneficial decisions as uncertainty increased. Students seemed to be more cautious when making collective decisions compared to individual decisions. This collective risk aversion highlighted the benefits of collective learning and decision making for risk management. From the qualitative results, common themes (such as “Informed Decision Making” and “Risk Preparedness”), common keywords (“flood”, “drought”, “climate”, “uncertainty”), and varying emotions observed in student responses indicated students’ awareness of and growing understanding about uncertainty and robust decision making, and pointed to the social/psychological aspects of playing the D4tD game and making decisions under uncertainty. In conclusion, these results attest to the benefit of the D4tD game as a tool within this university and departmental context to improve student understanding of and attitudes towards uncertainty and robust decision making for climate change adaptation and risk management.
