As a teaching assistant for this 14-week course, I assisted in advising students completing their capstone project. For this project, all students in the class worked together, integrating knowledge and experience from technical and professional skills acquired in the CEE undergraduate ABET-accredited curriculum. 
This year, students developed detailed designs for key elements of Little Negley Run at Larimer Park in Pittsburgh, including stormwater management, stream restoration, accessible trails, and a new set of stairs connecting streets through the park. I advised sub-groups within the class working on stormwater management using green/grey infrastructure within the park and accessible trails within the park.
