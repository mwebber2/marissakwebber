As a teaching assistant for this 14-week course, our team of three teaching assistants helped to prepare and grade assignments for a hybrid (in person and remote) class of 27 Sophomore students. I assisted in brainstorming and executing three design or design-and-build projects for the class, with significant contribution to the third project about sensing and structural health monitoring with Arduinos
I prepared and delivered a 15-minute in-class presentation to introduce students to Principles of Sustainable Engineering. I also held office hours once a week via Zoom.
