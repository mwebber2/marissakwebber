As a teaching assistant for this 7-week course, I helped to prepare and grade twice-weekly pre-class reading quizzes, twice-weekly in-class exercises and two homework assignments for a class of 23 PhD, Mastersâ€™, and Undergraduate students. I also helped to prepare and grade the final project. I assisted in designing various in-class exercises to help students remain engaged and encourage collaborative work, group discussions, and critical thinking in each class.
I prepared and delivered an 80-minute lecture about the equations used when designing and adapting transportation drainage infrastructure to non-stationarities (such as land use change and climate change), focusing on the Rational Method and SCS method. I also held one hour of office hours once a week to assist students and answer questions about assignments and class material.
